      Hello! My name is Talee Yang and I am currently attending the University of Minnesota coding bootcamp. In the past I have worked in the bio-pharmaceuticals industry as a manufacturing associate. I am very passionate about learning and I have an interest in coding and design. Once I graduate from the coding bootcamp, I look forward to starting a new career as a web developer.
