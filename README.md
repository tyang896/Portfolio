# Portfolio


## Description
This is a web app of my portfolio projects. This program uses react to render each page. The application features sections for portfolio, contact, resume, and about me. Currently the application still needs working functinality for the contact section and styling changes for the footer. I will make updates to these features in the future and add a cleaner design to the webpage.
